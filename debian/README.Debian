General Notes
=============

Several links and binaries have not been installed for Debian.  In
particular, the "header" command is not installed because it conflicts
with a binary of the same name in a different package.  Use "vips
im_header_int", "vips im_header_string", or "vips im_header_double"
instead.  Additionally, the hundreds of im_* links are not installed.
Use "vips im_command" instead of "im_command".
